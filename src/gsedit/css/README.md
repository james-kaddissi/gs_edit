# CSS Directory

This directory should be left untouched by manual edits. Saves made in this directory are disregarded because this directory is regenerated at runtime. This directory holds the active styles of the editor that the code reads from. To modify styles you can launch the CSS Editor within GS-Edit or you can manually edit the contents of the files in the original-css directory.
