# Original-CSS Directory

This directory is a placeholder for the active css directory. As you can see in many of the .qss files there are strings with a leading @ symbol. In QSS they would go unrecgonized, but at runtime GS-Edit copies replaces all the files in the css directory with copies of the ones in this directory, and then substitutes these values with their intended placeholder values. See the runtime_qss.py to add new placeholders or see how it works. As is the values of the placeholders are pulled from a singular json. The purpose of all this is to allow for easy mass replacement of any styling values. Instead of changing every single color of a certain value to the new desired value, you can just change it in the active-theme.json, and at runtime the mass replacement is performed.
